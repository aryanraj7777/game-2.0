🌿 SereneSpace: A Digital Sanctuary
SereneSpace is an immersive, web-based experience designed to calm the nervous system and provide a mental "reset" from anxiety, burnout, and daily stress. Unlike traditional games, there are no scores, no timers, and no competition—only peace.

✨ Core Features
🌌 Real-Time Cosmic Engine: A generative starfield that reacts to subtle mouse movements, creating a sense of depth and perspective.

🌲 Generative Forest: A procedural silhouette of a night forest that moves with organic "noise" algorithms to mimic wind.

✨ Zen Garden (Star-Seeding): Click or tap the sky to plant pulsating planets and create your own constellations.

🎧 Procedural Audio: A built-in sound engine that generates infinite "Pink Noise" (Rain and Forest Wind) rather than using repetitive loops.

🌙 Night-Mode Optimized: Designed with a low-light palette to reduce eye strain and blue-light exposure before sleep.

🧠 The Science of Calm
This project is built using principles of Environmental Psychology and Attention Restoration Theory (ART):

Soft Fascination: By providing visual patterns that are aesthetically pleasing but low-demand, the brain can recover from "Directed Attention Fatigue."

Parasympathetic Activation: The visual rhythms (4-7-8 cycles) are designed to help lower heart rate and blood pressure.

Awe Therapy: Viewing cosmic scales (stars and galaxies) helps reduce "self-referential processing," making personal worries feel smaller and more manageable.

🛠️ Technology Stack
p5.js: Used for the generative art and physics engine.

Web Audio API: Used for real-time procedural sound synthesis (no external audio files required).

HTML5/CSS3: Minimalist, responsive framework that works on mobile and desktop.

🚀 Installation & Hosting
This is a zero-dependency project. To run it:

Download the index.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser.

To Host: Upload the file to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for a live link.

📱 Mobile Use
For the best experience, open the link on your phone and select "Add to Home Screen". This removes the browser address bar and turns the sanctuary into a full-screen immersive app.

📜 Ethical Promise
No Data Collection: We do not track your movement or save your data.

No Addictive Loops: There are no "streaks" or daily rewards. Use it only when you need to feel better.

No Cost: This tool is free for everyone, forever.

“You don’t need to escape life. Sometimes, you just need a moment of calm.”
